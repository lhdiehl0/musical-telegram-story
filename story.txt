In the cold and windy winter of Detroit, Michigan the color gray has taken 
over for the season. While most stay inside and bundle in their big black 
puffy coats, one stands among them. When Sean Don steps out onto the streets 
of Detroit he looks to bring back his pop. Dressed in funky colors and 
vintage clothing, Sean brings the spirit into Detroit.
 
With his vintage hat, jeans and ripped out t-shirt, he transforms any scene into his own, leaving
regular Detroiters wondering if he's really a nice guy or just another
rock star. With his unique personality and unique way of walking, Sean has
been making Detroit's streets his own since 2006. Even the world-renowned rapper,
Eminem, agreed.

But then 2008 hit and Sean couldn't make money as a normal rapper now.  He was poor and,
as it turned out, all of his friends wanted his money.  He knew he had to return to 
his roots and truly differentiate himself.  He knew he had to do it; he had to surgically
replace his head with a marshmellow.  Even the DJ Marshmellow thought Sean was crazy.  But, the
surgery was a success. Sean now had a head made of straight marshmellows.

However he learned he could no longer rap without his mouth. He then had to learn Morse code 
so he could could make beats with his musical telegram. This idea was so out of the box 
he became one of Detroit's most famous producers.
