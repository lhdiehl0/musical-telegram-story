In the cold and windy winter of Detroit, Michigan the color gray has taken 
over for the season. While most stay inside and bundle in their big black 
puffy coats, one stands among them. When Sean Don steps out onto the streets 
of Detroit he looks to bring back his pop. Dressed in funky colors and 
vintage clothing, Sean brings the spirit into Detroit. 
With his vintage
hat, jeans and ripped out t-shirt, he transforms any scene into his own, leaving
regular Detroiters wondering if he's really a nice guy or just another
rock star. With his unique personality and unique way of walking, Sean has
been making Detroit's streets his own since 2006. Even the world-renowned rapper,
Eminem, agreed.
